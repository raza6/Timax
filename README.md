# Timax
**Timax** is a timer web application made for workouts built in JavaScript that uses material design.

## Usage
It's a web page, just launch it in your favorite browser.

### Configuration
- A workout session is composed of a set of runs. 
- Each run is separated by a long pause.
- A run is composed of a set of repetition of exercise. 
- Each repetition is separated by a medium pause.
- A repetition is composed of exercises and small pauses to switch between exercises.
- All exercises are of the same length.
- A run always starts by a small pause. 
- Long pause and medium pause do not add up, it's the longest one that is played.

The configuration panel allows tweaking all of those parameters. The UI is in French.

### Ringtone
- A single ring is played when a small pause starts
- A double ring is played when an exercise starts
- A triple ring is played when a medium or a long pause starts
